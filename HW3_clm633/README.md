# PUI2017 HW 3 - clm633.

## Group Info
- Q1: I did this individually, but helped others (notably Dana Chermesh) with their code.

- Q2: I worked with Prince Abunku and Matt Dwyer on this one. Matt helped clear out some extreme outliers using the pandas quantile function, and Prince and I worked together to research the 2-sample Z-test (just for funsies). Sunglyoung Kim was also present but we didn't specifically work on anything together. I also spoke with Sarah Schoengold, helping her with Pandas trivia.

- Q3: I think I worked with Prince + Matt in class but otherwise did this individually.
