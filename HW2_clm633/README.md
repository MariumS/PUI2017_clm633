# PUI2016 HW 2.

## First off:
You should check out this library: [https://github.com/ResidentMario/gtfs-tripify](https://github.com/ResidentMario/gtfs-tripify)

## Collaborators
- [Prince Abunku](https://github.com/princeaker/PUI2017_pa1303) -- mentioned the search code I used in the notebook in ass3 to search for CSV files because the CDF links were broken. Not sure if he used.

## Notes

### Assignment 2: `OnwardCalls` and `MonitoredVehicleCall` are equivalent, at least for pulling next stop information (I believe `OnwardCalls` gives you further out stops as well). Source: [MTA Docs](http://bustime.mta.info/wiki/Developers/SIRIMonitoredVehicleJourney) (you have to look at the comments above the `<MonitoredVehicleCall>` tag, because "documentation").

### Assignment 3 is in `ass3_clm633.ipynb`
